# MC Server Manager


Supported by the powerful (?) Bat format


# ðŸŒŸ Features


- Compact and lightweight
- Convenient for common configuration changes
- And more...


# ðŸ“¦ Quick Start


Download start.bat (Do not download any files starting with Version, as these older versions have many bugs, and I am not responsible for any issues that arise.) Run it, and generally speaking, you can use it with just one core. Due to the technical difficulty, I will not consider adding the function to download cores within the program.
