Now powered by Python with modern GUI! (Original batch version moved to `old/` folder)


# ðŸŒŸ Features


- Modern PyQt GUI interface
- Windows optimized
- Compact and lightweight
- Convenient for common configuration changes

- And more...


# ðŸ“¦ Quick Start


**Requirements:**
- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyQt5/PyQt6
- Java (for running Minecraft server)

**Installation:**
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Make sure you have a Minecraft server jar file (e.g., `server.jar`) in the same directory
4. Run the program: Double-click `start.bat` or run `python start.py`

The program will automatically create configuration files and handle EULA agreement. You just need to have a server core file to get started.
