# MC Server Manager
Supported by the powerful (?) Bat format
# ðŸŒŸ Features
- Compact and lightweight
- Convenient for common configuration changes
- And more...
# ðŸ“¦ Quick Start
Download start.bat (Do not download any files starting with Version, as these old versions have many bugs, and I am not responsible for any issues that arise.) Run it, and it should work. Generally, you can use it with just one core, but due to the technical difficulty, I will not consider adding the function to download cores within the program.
